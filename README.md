# regexplanet-perl-cgi

This is the Perl backend for RegexPlanet, a tool for online regular expression testing.  This version uses CGI.pm instead of Plack.

See [API docs](http://www.regexplanet.com/support/api.html) for what it is supposed to do.

See the [Perl online regex test page](http://www.regexplanet.com/advanced/perl/index.html) to use it to test your regular expressions.
